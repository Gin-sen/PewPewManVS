# Run game on Linux

Open a new terminal in the displayed desktop on your browser, go to folder `/usr/games` and run `./BombermanVS` to play the game.

Exit the game with `Esc` key at any point or click on the `Close Window` button.

## Host
You need to compile the game in order to run it.

In the `./sdl` folder, run `make` to compile.

If you make changes in the code afterward, use `make re` to remove old binaries and compile the new code.

Run the game with the command `./BombermanVS`.

# Run game on Windows(Docker only)
Remark : You can run the game localy but you hame to use Cygwin and stuff to compile using Windows-compatible libraries.
